### Data types
In programming data type is an important concept.
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
Python has the following data types built in default.

Text type: str
Numeric types: int, float, complex
Sequence types: list, tuple, range
Mapping type: dict
Set types: set, frozenset
Boolean type: bool
Binary types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None type: NoneType

#### Getting the data types
You can get the data types of any object by using the  `type()` function.
```

x = 5
print(type(x))
```

#### Setting the data types
In python the data type is set whe assign a value to a variable.
``x = "Hello World"`` 
This x is str data type.

#### Setting the specific  data type
If you want to specify the data type you can use the constructor functions
``x = str("Hello World")``
